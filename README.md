# Solo Project Proposal

## Description

Name: GamingVerse

A video game marketplace similar to those found on PlayStation or XBOX consoles but as a web application. Explore the gaming universe and find games to purchase. Save games to your favorites list to buy later. View game reviews and add your own as well. Must have an account for full functionalities. 

## Stack

* Language: Java (both front end and back end)
* Database: MySQL
* Tools: STS, VSC (preference for coding HTML then copied over)

## Features

**MVP (Minimal Viable Product)**
* Must have video game API as the entire app relies on this
* Login & Registration to be able to save reviews and likes
* Full CRUD on reviews: users are able to create-read-update-delete their reviews
* Favorites list: users are able to add and remove games to a list for easy navigation to purchase later
* Search capability
* Users can click on a genre and a list of video games will populate
* Users can view a video game's detail page

**Nice To Have**
* Bootstrap framework for all styling, adding plain CSS only as needed
* Responsive application (using specific Bootstrap components for this)
* Advanced/Professional Bootstrap usage (carousels, scroll, dropdowns, videos, etc.)
* Membership levels for subscriptions (early access deals, free play on paid games, etc.)
* Many-to-Many relationship (reviews have likes if considered helpful)
* Functioning purchase capabilities (the buy button is in the wireframe, however no purchase page has been done in wireframe yet until I learn how to incorporate this)
* Pagination and Sorting
* Deployment
